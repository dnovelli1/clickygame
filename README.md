## Description

In this assignment I was prompted with the task of creating a clicky game with React. I needed to create a React application that would render images onto the page. When a user clicks on of the imagegs the game starts. The user would continue to click images, being sure to not click the same image twice or you lose! 


Please have a look at the full application deployed at the link below:
